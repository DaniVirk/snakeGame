# Snake Game in C++

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C++. The game involves controlling a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing in size with each food item consumed. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen.

## Features
- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Navigate the snake around the screen to eat food.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: As the snake grows, it becomes harder to avoid collisions.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with its own body or the borders of the game area.
